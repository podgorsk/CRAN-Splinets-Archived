\title{Data on tire responses to a rough road profile}
\format{
numerical \code{4095 x 101} dataframe: \code{tire}
}
\usage{
data(tire)
}
\description{
These are simulated data of tire responses to a rough road at the high-transient
event. The simulations have been made based on the fit of the so-called Slepian model
to a non-Gaussian rough road profile. Further details can be found in the reference. The
responses provided are measured at the wheel and thus describing the tire response. 
There are 100 functional measurments, kept column-wise in the matrix.
Additionally, the time instants of the measurements are given as the first column in the matrix.
Since the package uses the so-called "lazy load", the matrix 
is directly available without an explicit load of the data.
This means that \code{data(tire)} does not need to be invoked.
The data were saved using \code{compress='xz'} option, which requires 3.5 or higher version of R.
The data are uploaded as a dataframe, thus \code{as.matrix(tire)} is needed if the matrix form is required.
